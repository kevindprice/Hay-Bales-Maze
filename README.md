## A childhood invention, made into a real digital maze in Javascript. Isn't it aMAZEing?

This repo is outdated, but this is an interesting version. The instructions are given as a single readable page, which you read at once before entering the maze. Note, the main file is maze.html, not index.html. This was the very beginning of my understanding of HTML, and I hadn't caught onto this yet.
